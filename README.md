# hangry? find-me-food!

[Go to App Here](https://find-me-food.firebaseapp.com/)

This project was born from my love of food and traveling. I travel a lot and struggle at times with finding places to eat if I'm not familiar with the area or not with any locals. This app will solve both the problems of finding available restaurants and guiding you there.

This application is intended to generate a list of restaurants in a user's area based on their input of zip code, city or state. Users can browse results, which include important information regarding a business's contact information, website and location retrieved from Locu API. If a user is interested in finding out more, they can call the phone number provided, visit the linked website or click on the address, which redirects the page to Google maps with the exact location. Users can do a new search by clicking on the 'new search' button which will refresh the page.    

### Technologies
This application was developed in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I used AJAX requests to retrieve information from Locu API about available restaurants in a specified area based on user input. Additionally, Google's font API provided beautiful fonts for the text. Another styling tool that I implemented was bootstrap to create responsive design. JavaScript was used to dynamically populate the page with information for each restaurant as it was being retrieved. An Agile workflow was followed for the planning, organization and development of the app.

### API Key
The data utilized by this app to retrieve restaurant information is provided by Locu Api using an API key that can be solicited from their website at https://dev.locu.com/.
