hangry? find-me-food!

This project was born from my love of food and traveling. I travel a lot and struggle at times with finding places to eat if I'm not familiar with the area or not with any locals. This app will solve both the problems of finding available restaurants and guiding you there.

This application is intended to generate a list of restaurants in a user's area based on their input of zip code, city or state. Users can browse results, which include important information regarding a business's contact information, website and location. If a user is interested in finding out more, they can call the phone number provided, visit the linked website or click on the address, which redirects the page to Google maps with the exact location. Users can do a new search by clicking on the 'new search' button which will refresh the page.
